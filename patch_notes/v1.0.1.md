# Patch Notes v1.0.1

## Feedback Items Addressed

### Fixed: Thanks for thumb up overlay behind comment box
- **Issue**: The "Thanks for thumb up" overlay was appearing behind the comment box, making the "Personalized Game Creation" content partially invisible
- **Root Cause**: The modal was being rendered within a component container that created a stacking context, preventing proper z-index layering
- **Fix**: Implemented a React portal to render the modal at the document body level, bypassing stacking context issues and increased z-index to `z-[9999]`
- **Files Modified**: `src/components/StatsBar.tsx`

### Fixed: Comments not loading in local development
- **Issue**: Comments API was returning "Invalid API key" error in local development while working fine in production
- **Root Cause**: Comments API was using `supabaseService` (requiring service role key) instead of the regular `supabase` client
- **Fix**: Modified comments API to use the regular Supabase client instead of the service client, which is sufficient for comments functionality
- **Files Modified**: `src/app/api/games/[slug]/comments/route.ts`

### Confirmed: Admin URL simplification already implemented
- **Status**: The admin interface is already accessible at `/admin` instead of `/admin/games`
- **Note**: This feedback item was already resolved in a previous update

## Environment Configuration Note

If you're still experiencing API key issues in local development, ensure your `.env` file contains a valid `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. The service role key should be a long JWT token (starting with `eyJ...`) that you can find in your Supabase dashboard under Settings > API.

## Technical Details

- Comments functionality now uses row-level security (RLS) policies instead of service role permissions
- Improved error handling for better debugging experience
- Modal z-index hierarchy optimized for better user experience
